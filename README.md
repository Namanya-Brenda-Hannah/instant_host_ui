# INSTANT HOST UI — Hostel Discovery & Booking Frontend

> **Learning Project** — A React 19 + Vite 6 single-page application that
> talks to the INSTANT HOST REST API. Built by MUSASIZI KENNETH to help students
> at **Uganda Christian University (UCU)** understand how modern frontend
> applications are structured and how they communicate with a backend API.

## What is This App?

INSTANT HOST UI is the student-facing web application for the INSTANT HOST hostel
platform. Depending on the logged-in user's role it shows different pages:

- **Students** browse hostels, view rooms, make bookings, pay, and leave reviews.
- **Custodians** (hostel owners) manage their hostels and rooms, and
  approve or decline booking requests.
- **Admins** manage all users across the platform.

---

## What You Will Learn

- **React fundamentals** — components, props, state, effects
- **React Router v7** — client-side routing, protected routes, role guards
- **API calls from React** — `fetch`, async/await, error handling
- **JWT authentication** in a SPA — storing tokens, decoding payloads,
  attaching `Authorization` headers
- **Material-UI (MUI) v7** — a component library for building professional UIs
- **Responsive design** — adapting layouts for mobile and desktop
- **Global state** — lifting state to `AppRouter`, passing via props
- **Vite** — a fast modern build tool and development server

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Minimum version | Notes |
|------|----------------|-------|
| **Node.js** | v18 | https://nodejs.org |
| **npm** | v9 | Comes with Node.js |
| **instant_host_api** running | — | The UI is useless without the backend |

Check your versions:

```bash
node --version   # v18.x.x or higher
npm --version    # 9.x.x or higher
```

---

## Setup — Step by Step

> **Important:** Start the backend API first. The UI makes API calls to
> `http://localhost:3000`. If the API is not running you will see network
> errors in the browser.

### Step 1 — Start the backend (in a separate terminal)

```bash
cd instant_host_api
npm start        # starts the Express server on http://localhost:3000
```

### Step 2 — Install frontend dependencies

Open a **new terminal** tab and run:

```bash
cd instant_host_ui
npm install
```

### Step 3 — Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Vite will start a local server. You should see output like:

```
  VITE v6.x.x  ready in 300 ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ➜  Network: http://192.168.x.x:5173/
```

### Step 4 — Open the app

Navigate to **http://localhost:5173** in your browser.

Log in with any of the seeded accounts (password is `password123` for all):

| Email | Role |
|-------|------|
| `alice@student.com` | Student |
| `john@instanthost.com` | Custodian |
| `admin@instanthost.com` | Admin |

---

## Environment Variables

By default the app calls the API at `http://localhost:3000`. If you need to
point it at a different host (e.g. a deployed server), create a file named
`.env` in the `instant_host_ui/` directory:

```dotenv
# The base URL of your INSTANT HOST API server
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

Then update `src/utils/api.js` to read this value:

```js
const BASE = import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL || 'http://localhost:3000';
```

> **Why `VITE_` prefix?** Vite only exposes environment variables that start
> with `VITE_` to your browser code — other variables stay server-side only.
> This prevents secrets from leaking into the built bundle.

## How the Frontend Talks to the API

All API communication lives in **`src/utils/api.js`**.

Each function follows the same pattern:

```js
// Example: fetch all hostels
export async function searchHostels(params = {}) {
    const query = new URLSearchParams(params).toString();
    const res = await fetch(`${BASE}/api/hostels?${query}`);
    const data = await res.json();
    if (!res.ok) throw new Error(data.error || 'Failed');
    return data;
}
```

1. Build the URL (with any query parameters)
2. Call `fetch()`
3. Parse the JSON response
4. If `res.ok` is false (status 400–599), throw an error so the calling
   component can show a message to the user
5. Otherwise return the data

Protected endpoints also include the JWT:

```js
export async function getMyBookings(token) {
    const res = await fetch(`${BASE}/api/bookings/my`, {
        headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` },
    });
    // ...
}
```

---

## Authentication Flow

```
1. User fills in Login form
        ↓
2. Login.jsx calls api.login(email, password)
        ↓
3. API responds with { token, user }
        ↓
4. AppRouter stores token in:
   - React state  (so components re-render)
   - localStorage (so it survives a page refresh)
        ↓
5. decodeToken() reads the JWT payload (base64) to get { id, email, role }
   — no extra API call needed
        ↓
6. Every protected API call attaches:
   Authorization: Bearer <token>
        ↓
7. On logout: token cleared from state + localStorage → redirected to /login
```

---

## Role-Based Access

`AppRouter.jsx` wraps role-restricted routes in a `<RoleRoute>` guard:

```jsx
<Route path="/my-bookings" element={
    <Page token={token} user={user} handleLogout={handleLogout}>
        <RoleRoute user={user} roles={['STUDENT']}>
            <MyBookings token={token} />
        </RoleRoute>
    </Page>
} />
```

If a CUSTODIAN navigates to `/my-bookings`, `RoleRoute` redirects them to
`/dashboard` immediately. This mirrors the backend's `authorize()` middleware
— both layers check the role.

The sidebar navigation in `ModernLayout.jsx` also filters menu items by role,
so users only see links relevant to them.

---

## Key Concepts Explained

### What is a SPA (Single-Page Application)?

The browser loads `index.html` **once**. After that, React Router intercepts
link clicks and swaps out the page content without a full browser reload. This
makes navigation feel instant.

### Why store the JWT in localStorage?

`localStorage` persists across page refreshes and browser tabs. The alternative
— storing it in React state only — would log the user out every time they
refresh the page.

> **Security note:** localStorage is readable by JavaScript, making it
> vulnerable to XSS attacks. For a production app, consider using an
> `httpOnly` cookie instead. For a learning project, localStorage is fine.

### What is a custom hook (`useToast`)?

A custom hook is a regular JavaScript function whose name starts with `use`
and which calls other React hooks. `useToast` encapsulates the toast
`open/close/message` state so any page can show notifications without
copy-pasting the same state logic:

```js
const { toast, showToast, hideToast } = useToast();
showToast('Booking confirmed!', 'success', 'Done');
```

### Why does `ModernLayout` use a `Drawer`?

On desktop (≥ 960 px) the sidebar is always visible (`variant="permanent"`).
On mobile it slides in as an overlay when the user taps the hamburger icon
(`variant="temporary"`). This is the standard responsive navigation pattern.

### What is MUI's `sx` prop?

Instead of writing a separate CSS file, MUI's `sx` prop lets you write styles
directly on a component as a JavaScript object:

```jsx
<Box sx={{ bgcolor: '#0E7C6B', borderRadius: 2, p: 3 }}>
```

It supports responsive values, theme tokens, and pseudo-selectors like `&:hover`.
